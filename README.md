## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, User Sessions, Song Model and JSON API

In Phase 1, I will begin by implementing user signup and authentication (using
BCrypt). There will be a basic landing page after signup that will contain the
container for the application's root React component. I will also set up the
sessions aspect of the website. Before building out the front end,
I will begin by setting up a full JSON API for Notes.
